    Fixed a bug that formatted the input text awkwardly. 
    
    Fixed issue where days were constantly subtracted from the allowed days 
    list when the incorrect day was inputed. Also fixed the same issue for the 
    months list. 

V4.3 ---- 09.02.2020
    Now gives correct day range for February and leap years.
    
    Asks yes or no if you wish to limit airmass's, then for value.
    
    Double checks if plots wants to be saved when parsing mulitple objects.
    
V4.2 ---- 08.29.2020
    Added the ability to have an airmass cutt off

        Should give retry option instead of crashing on bad inputs now.
    Changes Language of location input to make more clear.
    
V4.0 ---- 07.24.2020
    Complete Re-haul to utilize astroquery, now it only requires a list of
    ID numbers and it will automatically pull ephemeris's using astroquery lib.
    
    No longer Utilizes the GUI, all inputs are controlled through command line
    input now.
    
    A lot has changed to much to keep track of here. Refer to V3.0 code to see
    decrepid actions, only function brought over and not heavily modified 
    is find_oppositions().
